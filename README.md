**Project Description**

In this project, I utilized SQL to analyze ordering data for a pizza delivery business, aiming to derive actionable insights that could inform strategic decision-making. My primary focus was on understanding customer preferences and ordering patterns. I started by identifying the most common pizza sizes ordered, which provided valuable information on customer choices and demand for specific products.

Furthermore, I examined the distribution of orders by hour of the day to pinpoint peak ordering times, allowing the business to optimize staffing and resource allocation during high-demand periods. I calculated the average amount of pizzas ordered per day, giving insights into overall business performance and helping forecast future sales.

Additionally, I analyzed the revenue generated by each type of pizza, determining each type's percentage contribution to total revenue. This information is crucial for identifying high-performing menu items and informing marketing strategies. Overall, the project utilized data-driven insights to enhance business operations and customer satisfaction within the pizza industry.
